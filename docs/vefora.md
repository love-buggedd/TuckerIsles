# Vefora
... is a bot made with [Tucker Island][disc] in mind. It's an automated logging tool for moderators and users alike. Most logs are posted in <span class="mention">#public-logs</span> under `VEFORA __LOGS`. Created by <span class="mention">@xyb</span> it's a dependable tool that tracks a large amount of data related to the server.

??? question "Common Q&A"
    <b>Q:</b> <i>Why can't I use some commands that Vefora has?</i>
    <br/>
    <b>A:</b> Not all commands/information is accessible to the general public. If you'd like to request specific information that you cannot access as a regular user please contact <span class="mention">@xyb</span> to submit a data-request.
    
    <b>Q:</b> <i>Am I allowed to privately request data in court?</i>
    <br/>
    <b>A:</b> No, if participating in court please refer to using a verbal request rather than a private one. This action when used in court counts as using a witness if you decide to pull <span class="mention">@xyb</span> up for a testimony in regards to accessing the data desired.

## Documentation
Vefora has a variety of functions.
