# Economy
The economy system is managed by the Discord bot [UnbelievaBoat][unb]. The economy influences events that happen in the server, roles, and more.
<br/>
If you'd like to go through the commands yourself please refer to:

!!! tip inline end "Notice"
    Please only use economy-related commands in the designated channels, <span class="mention">#economy</span>, and <span class="mention">#cell-block</span>.

- typing `/` in <span class="mention">#economy</span>, pressing the UnbelievaBoat icon and scrolling through.

- visiting the official [command page][cmds] they provide. The server uses the default prefix, `!` for all commands.

## Getting Started
The economy system is simple, this cohesive guide will help you get started earning!

### Earning Money
Earning money is an essential part of the experience on Tucker Island. It's good to know the basics!

#### work
You pick up a job in the T-Regime and earn yourself `ᛟ17-23.`<br/>
This command is usable every two minutes.
```
/work
```

#### crime
You can commit a crime in the T-Regime and potentially earn `ᛟ600-1250`.<br/>
It's worth mentioning that there is a `60%` chance of failure and a fine of `20 - 40%`.<br/>
This command is usable every twenty-five minutes.
```
/crime
```

#### rob
Allows you to rob another member of the Discord server, taking all the Cash they have.<br/>
This command does have a chance of a fine, but all parameters of it are unknown.
```
/rob <user>
```

* `<user>` - <span class="transparent">Mention a user to attempt robbing them.</span>

#### collect-income
You have a government mandated ᛟ100 that you earn every day. This command allows you to recieve that money.<br/>
For anyone that has a government-related role, you will recieve an additional amount of money on top of the regularly mandated payout. This amount is determined based on the following formula, `(<people in server>*100)*0.05`.
```
/collect-income
```

### Storing Money
When your money is stored it ensures other members of the server cannot rob you of your cash.

#### deposit
Allows you to deposit `all` or a specific amount of cash into your bank.
```
/deposit <amount | all>
```

* `<amount | all>` - <span class="transparent">You can type a specific amount to deposit, or type `all` to deposit all the money you have into your bank. Optionally you can just leave it blank and use purely `/deposit` to deposit all, this method doesn't work with the `!` prefix.</span>

#### withdraw
Allows you to withdraw `all` or a specific amount of cash into your bank.
```
/withdraw <amount / all>
```

* `<amount | all>` - <span class="transparent">Refer to `deposit`'s explanation as it functions the same.</span>

### Spending Money
The ability to spend money is an important part of the server as you can buy collectables, and usable items of varying tradability. Some items will be exclusive or limited edition raising their value and encouraging in-server trading (selling). Usable items generally earn you benefits inside specific events, give your roles, or allow for other features.

#### store
